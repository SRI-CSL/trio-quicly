# trio-quicly
Reference implementation of QUIC-LY transport protocol (which is QUIC without encryption) using the [Python Trio][_Trio] framework.

## QUIC-LY

**QUIC-LY** stands for **QUIC Lean Yet-reliable** ‚Äî a minimalist, unencrypted variant of the QUIC transport protocol. Built for Python, QUIC-LY emphasizes simplicity, ordered delivery, and congestion control with as little overhead as possible.

---

## üöÄ Overview

QUIC-LY is designed for use cases where encryption is not required, but reliability and efficiency still matter ‚Äî such as controlled environments, internal RPC systems, or research/prototyping.

It trims down the original QUIC protocol by removing TLS, reducing metadata, and focusing on just what you need:  
**Reliable delivery, congestion control, and stream multiplexing ‚Äî without the crypto baggage.**

QUIC-LY is a simplified version of QUIC for educational and experimental purposes.  
It omits encryption, focusing on core transport functionality.

QUIC v1 was standardized in May 2021 in [RFC 9000][_RFC 9000] and accompanied by [RFC 9002][_RFC 9002] ("QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control").
