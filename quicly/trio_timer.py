# Note from FRC 9002 (Section 6.2.1):

# When a PTO timer expires, the PTO backoff MUST be increased, resulting in the PTO period being set to twice its
# current value. The PTO backoff factor is reset when an acknowledgment is received, except in the following case. A
# server might take longer to respond to packets during the handshake than otherwise. To protect such a server from
# repeated client probes, the PTO backoff is not reset at a client that is not yet certain that the server has
# finished validating the client's address. That is, a client does not reset the PTO backoff factor on receiving
# acknowledgments in Initial packets.
#
# This exponential reduction in the sender's rate is important because consecutive PTOs might be caused by loss of
# packets or acknowledgments due to severe congestion. Even when there are ack-eliciting packets in flight in
# multiple packet number spaces, the exponential increase in PTO occurs across all spaces to prevent excess load on
# the network. For example, a timeout in the Initial packet number space doubles the length of the timeout in the
# Handshake packet number space.
#
# The total length of time over which consecutive PTOs expire is limited by the idle timeout.
