    """A QUIC endpoint.  Should be instantiated as either a server or a client.

    A single UDP socket can serve arbitrarily many QUIC connections simultaneously.
    A `QuicEndpoint` server object holds the UDP socket and manages these connections,
    which are represented as `QuicConnection` objects.  A `QuicEndpoint` client object
    instead connects only once to a remote QUIC server and uses the same UDP socket
    for sending and receiving data while that one connection exists.

    QUIC Connections and ultimately the created Streams do the receiving and sending
    of data (in bytes) over Trio memory channels with their attached Endpoint, which
    manages the guarded UDP socket and translates stream send/receive to socket send
    and receive operations.

      incoming_packets_buffer (int):
