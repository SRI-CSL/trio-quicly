class QuicEndpoint:
    """A QUIC endpoint.  Should be instantiated as either a server or a client.

    A single UDP socket can serve arbitrarily many QUIC connections simultaneously.
    A `QuicEndpoint` server object holds the UDP socket and manages these connections,
    which are represented as `QuicConnection` objects.  A `QuicEndpoint` client object
    instead connects only once to a remote QUIC server and uses the same UDP socket
    for sending and receiving data while that one connection exists.

    QUIC Connections and ultimately the created Streams do the receiving and sending
    of data (in bytes) over Trio memory channels with their attached Endpoint, which
    manages the guarded UDP socket and translates stream send/receive to socket send
    and receive operations.

    Args:
      socket: (trio.socket.SocketType): A ``SOCK_DGRAM`` socket.
      incoming_packets_buffer (int):

    .. attribute:: socket
                   incoming_packets_buffer

        """Initiate an outgoing QUIC connection, which entails the handshake.  As QUIC 
        is based on UDP, we cannot reliably resolve the remote address until after receiving
        the first reply.

        If this endpoint already manages a (prior) connection to the same remote address,
        it will return the old connection after checking that it isn't closed.

        TODO: For simplicity, a client can only support 1 QUIC connection.  Therefore, if this
         method is called multiple times and to different destination addresses, it will
         silently fail...

        Args:
          target_address: The address to connect to. Usually a (host, port) tuple, like
            ``("127.0.0.1", 12345)``.  Note that unlike IPv4, in IPv6 the wildcard address
            does not resolve to localhost as a remote address.  Use the IPv6 wildcard address
            "::" only for servers that bind to them to all interfaces on localhost.
          client_configuration: The client configuration to use (or None for default values)
          connection_established_timeout: how many seconds before giving up on initial connection establishment.
          initial_retransmit_timeout: Since UDP is an unreliable protocol, it's
            possible that some of the packets we send during the handshake will get
            lost. To handle this, QUIC-LY uses a timer to automatically retransmit
            handshake packets that don't receive a response. This lets you set the
            timeout we use to detect packet loss. Ideally, it should be set to ~1.5
            times the round-trip time to your peer, but 1 second is a reasonable
            default. There's `some useful guidance here
            <https://tlswg.org/dtls13-spec/draft-ietf-tls-dtls13.html#name-timer-values>`__.

            This is the *initial* timeout, because if packets keep being lost then we
            will automatically back off to longer values, to avoid overloading the
            network.
