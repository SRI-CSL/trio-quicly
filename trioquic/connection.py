    A single UDP socket can serve arbitrarily many QUIC connections simultaneously.
    A `QuicEndpoint` server object holds the UDP socket and manages these connections,

    instead connects only once to a remote QUIC server and uses the same UDP socket
    for sending and receiving data while that one connection exists.

    QUIC Connections and ultimately the created Streams do the receiving and sending
    of data (in bytes) over Trio memory channels with their attached Endpoint, which
    manages the guarded UDP socket and translates stream send/receive to socket send
    and receive operations.

          sending anything. In this case it doesn't make sense to take a
          screenshot, then wait 0.5 seconds, and then send it, because the
          screen will keep changing while you wait; it's better to wait 0.5
          seconds, then take the screenshot, and then send it, because this
          way the data you deliver will be more
          up-to-date. Using :meth:`wait_send_all_might_not_block` makes it
